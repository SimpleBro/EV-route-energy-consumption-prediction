# Electric vehicle energy consumption prediction model analysis
My first interaction with Python was during my Master's degree in Intelligent Transport Systems at the UNIZG Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences.

On the course "Data Mining" we were tasked to pick out a large data set and either conduct a prediction or a classification on it. Thus this project emerged with the aim of predicting electric vehicle route energy consumption using the basic data provided by GPS tracking vehicles. Polynominal MLR, Decision Tree and MLR models were analysed in the seminar.

During my Master's studies in 2020, I started my work as a full-time student intern at a german automotive industry company for 6 months. After the internship ended, I continued to work for the company part-time while writing my Masters thesis, and following graduation in 2021, I continued to work for them. With some minor deviations, I worked almost exclusively in Python; software development, automation of functional security testing and penetration testing.
