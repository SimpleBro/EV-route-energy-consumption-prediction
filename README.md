# Electric vehicle energy consumption prediction model analysis
My first interaction with Python was during my Masters degree in Intelligent Transport Systems at the UNIZG Faculty of Traffic Sciences.
On the course "Data Mining" we were tasked to pick out a large data set and either conduct a prediction or a clasification on it.
Thus this project was made with the aim of predicting electric vehicle route energy consumption using Polynominal MLR / Decision Tree / MLR.

During my Masters studies in 2020, I started my work as a full-time student intern at a german automotive industry company for 6 months. After the intership ended, I continued to work for the company part-time while writing my Masters thesis, and following graduation in 2021, I continued to work for them. With some minor deviations, I worked in Python; software development, automation of functional security testing and penetration testing
